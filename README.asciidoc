ArgfulJuggler
-------------

__For Juggling Collections__

NOTE: This plugin is pre-alpha -- it is merely a thought exercise for now.

ArtfulJuggler is intended to assist with navigating around and
shifting elements within collections like argument lists, arrays and
dictionaries -- __inside your editor__.
